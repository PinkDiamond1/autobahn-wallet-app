## Autobahn Wallet App 🏎
> Your BTC in the fast lane

The Autobahn Wallet App is a React Native App which uses the [Autobahn Network](https://autobahn.network/) to transfer Bitcoin quickly, privately and with low transaction fees.
The Autobahn Network employs the most sophisticated technologies to have emerged from the blockchain world over recent years to build a decentralized network, tailored for payments.

### Setup
This wallet app is developed on the basis of [Expo](https://expo.io/).
If you want to contribute to the project, you can [read here](https://expo.io/learn) how to set up Expo. Once you have installed Expo and cloned this repository, you can start the app in the project directory via ``expo start``.

### Developed by Tixl gGmbH
Tixl is a non-profit FinTech company based in Hamburg, Germany. Tixl is the company behind the "Autobahn Network" project, a next-generation payment network. MTXLT (later TXL) is a token issued by Tixl, and the flagship asset of the Autobahn Network, which can be transferred with zero fees. The Autobahn Network allows Bitcoin, and other digital assets, to be transferred quickly and privately with low transaction fees.
While we are developing the Tixl ecosystem, MTXLT already runs on Binance Chain as a BEP-2 token "MTXLT" and can be traded on [Binance DEX](https://www.binance.org/en/trade/MTXLT-286_BNB) and [Probit](https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/MTXLT-BTC).
